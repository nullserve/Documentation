It is used for deploying and hosting/serving your application in developer-friendly manner.

## What is "serverless"?

"Serverless" doesn't literally mean "no servers". Just like "cloud is just somebody else's computer" was the confused response to "cloud", "serverless" is just somebody else's managed servers. It combines Functions as a Service (FaaS), Database as a Service (DBaaS), Backend as a Service(BaaS), and, pretty much anything "as a Service". "Serverless" is a term that summarizes "X as a Service" where X is everything used to build an application. Rather than enumerating all of the "X as a Service" that a project uses, "serverless" signifies using any number of these tools as your application needs them.
