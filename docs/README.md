# NullServe Documentation

NullServe documentation lives here in source form.
To see the docs live, go to https://docs.nullserve.com

## Project structure

The project itself uses docsify to hoist markdown files into a canned documentation style.
All of the documentation can be browsed in the `/docs/` folder using github's renderer.

## Building

If you're using docsify dev tools, the docs should update and build like any other docsify project.

<!-- TODO: Actually write something here -->

The production build runs on continuous integration and deployment from master.
It should take no longer than a few minutes to see your changes, although reloading the page may be necessary.
