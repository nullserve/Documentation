# Getting Started

To deploy an application, you should use the CLI which will abstract the API calls away into a command that can easily be run on your local developer machine or on CI/CD.

## Installing the CLI

The CLI is available in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nullserve/cli).
To install it, run:

`yarn add --dev @nullserve/cli`

or for `npm` users:

`npm install --save-dev @nullserve/cli`
